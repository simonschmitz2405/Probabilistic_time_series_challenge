# Probabilistic_time_series_challenge
Time Series Challenge during the winter semester 2024/25 at KIT

## Motivation

Statistical forecasts are relevant across all fields of society. In this project, students make, evaluate and communicate their own statistical forecasts in a realistic real-time setting. We consider probabilistic forecasts that involve a measure of uncertainty in addition to a point forecast. Students are asked to make forecasts of several real-world time series (including energy demand and bike traffic in Heidelberg). Historical data on all series are available from public sources that are updated as time proceeds. While the time series differ from each other in important ways, statistical methods can meaningfully be used for prediction in all cases. We focus on quantile forecasts which are useful to measure forecast uncertainty in a relatively simple way.
